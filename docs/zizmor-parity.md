# zizmor parity

> [!WARNING]
> This is a tracking document for planned work. None of the planned rules below exist yet unless the status says so.

jactionlint v2 aims to cover the security and policy territory that [zizmor](https://docs.zizmor.sh/audits/) covers, so that
a repository does not need to run two tools. Parity is tracked **per audit**. jactionlint makes **no blanket claim** that
it replaces zizmor: an audit is only marked as covered after a differential run against zizmor over a corpus of real
repositories shows comparable findings and no false positives for rules enabled by default.

How to read the table:

- **Planned ID** is the stable rule ID jactionlint intends to use. IDs reuse zizmor's audit names so users can map them.
- **Phase / batch** refers to the v2 plan: the batch letters are Phase 3 rule batches. A is checks on data that is already
  parsed, B permissions and pinning, C expression analysis, D run-script analysis, E `dependabot.yml`, G online checks.
  Online checks only run with the opt-in `-online` flag and never in the playground.
- **Profile** is the profile the rule is proposed for (`default`, `strict` or `all`, see [the v2 migration](v2-migration.md)).
  It is not final until the false-positive review of the corpus. Two rows use an activation mode instead of a profile:
  `online` rules run only with the opt-in `-online` flag, whatever the profile, and `opt-in (allow/deny config)` rules do
  nothing until you configure an allow or deny list.
- **Parity** will become `full`, `partial` or `not planned` once the differential corpus test exists. Until then every
  row says `not yet assessed`.
